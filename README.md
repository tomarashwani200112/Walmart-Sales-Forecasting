## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

Walmart, one of the worldâ€™s largest retailers, operates across various sectors with a wide product range. A key challenge is accurately forecasting weekly sales at individual stores. Inaccurate predictions can result in:

- **Stockouts** â†’ Lost sales and dissatisfied customers
- **Overstocks** â†’ Increased inventory costs and product waste

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate future sales using available historical and store-related data.
